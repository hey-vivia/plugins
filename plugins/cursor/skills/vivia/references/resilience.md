# Vivia mid-session resilience

How to maintain quality during long sessions: compaction, restart-from-scratch, and quality decay.

Agents read this file at session start (for resume mode) and after any compaction signal (memory gaps, uncertain progress, "continue" / "resume" requests).

## 1. Why long sessions fail

Two failure modes can reduce Vivia's data quality:

1. **Compaction.** The conversation is summarized to fit context limits. The agent's memory of the plan, the decisions, and what it has already done gets reduced to whatever the summarizer keeps. When the agent wakes back up, it has less context than when it started.
2. **Quality decay.** As the session grows, agents may provide less detail. Task 5 has a 3-sentence description and 4 binary ACs; task 35 has a single sentence and "works correctly" as an AC. Limited context can reduce detail.

> **Failure case:** a decompose run restarts from scratch and creates LUM-1..12 again on top of the existing LUM-1..12. The graph contains duplicate tasks, the project state is unclear, and users lose trust.

**The principle that prevents both:** treat Vivia state plus a local working file as the agent's memory, not the conversation.

---

## 2. Persist the plan to Vivia, not to the chat

After any approved gate (decompose Phase 1, onboarding Phase 3, brainstorm synthesis), append the approved plan to the project's `description` field.

- **Why.** The project description is durable across machines and survives session compaction. The chat does not.
- **Caveat.** `vivia_workspace action='update' description='...'` REPLACES the field; it does not append. Read-modify-write.
- **Effect.** The plan becomes recoverable on any session restart. `vivia_get project='<identifier>' view='meta'` returns the description including your plan. Token-cheap retrieval.

**Read-modify-write procedure:**

1. Read the current description via `vivia_get project='<identifier>' view='meta'` (or reuse it if already in your context).
2. Build the new value:
   ```
   <existing description>

   ## Decomposition Plan (approved <date>)

   <plan markdown>
   ```
3. `vivia_workspace action='update' project='<identifier>' description='<combined>'`.

---

## 3. Local working file (supplement to project description)

For high-write phases (decompose Phase 2, onboarding Phase 4), maintain a local working file alongside the project-description plan. Both should exist; they answer different questions.

| | Project description | Local working file |
|---|---|---|
| **Stored in** | Vivia server | `.vivia/<workflow>-<projectIdentifier>.md` |
| **Best at** | Authoritative cross-machine plan | Progress checklist, scratch notes, in-flight decisions |
| **Cost to write** | MCP roundtrip | Local I/O (free) |
| **Survives** | Any session, any machine | Compaction on the same machine |
| **Limit** | Stay concise; it is the user's project description | Richer; full discovery notes are welcome |

**Location:** `.vivia/<workflow>-<projectIdentifier>.md`. Examples:

- `.vivia/decompose-LUM.md`
- `.vivia/onboarding-KRN.md`

**Structure:**

```markdown
# Decompose working file: LUM

projectId: 0b6e4a2d-9c1f-4e83-8a57-3d2f5b7c9e14
session: 2026-05-08
status: in-progress

## Plan (approved)

<full plan content from Phase 1, verbatim>

## Progress

- [x] LUM-1: Initialize Turborepo monorepo (created 2026-05-08)
- [x] LUM-2: Configure shared TypeScript tooling
- [ ] LUM-3: Define ClickHouse schema
- [ ] LUM-4: Define PostgreSQL schema
- ... (one line per task in the plan; check when created)

## Decisions in flight

- (decisions made or being considered, not yet persisted on a task)

## Notes / open questions

- (working notes, things to verify, ambiguities to resolve)
```

**Lifecycle:**

1. **Initialize**, immediately after the HARD-GATE clears and the plan is persisted to the project description.
   - `Bash`: `mkdir -p .vivia`
   - `Bash`: append `.vivia/` to `.gitignore` if not already present:
     ```
     grep -qxF '.vivia/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.vivia/' >> .gitignore
     ```
   - `Write` the file using the structure above.
2. **Update** the progress checklist after every batch of task creates: every 5 to 10 tasks for decompose, 3 to 5 for onboarding. Update the notes section as new questions or in-flight decisions surface.
3. **Read first on resume**, when session-start runs resume mode or a compaction signal triggers mid-session.
   - Check the local file first via `Read`. If found, it has progress and notes; use it.
   - If missing, fall back to the project description (cross-machine scenario).
   - Either way, `vivia_activity project='<identifier>' since='<last certain instant>'` shows what was created while your context is incomplete; the batch creator dedupes by exact title regardless.
4. **Cleanup or archive** when the workflow completes. Either:
   - Delete `.vivia/<workflow>-<projectIdentifier>.md`, or
   - Rename to `.vivia/archive/<workflow>-<projectIdentifier>-<date>.md` if the user wants a paper trail.

The `.vivia/` directory is scratch space. Do not commit it. Before the first
write, check that `.gitignore` excludes it.

---

## 4. Resume mode (always run before any write phase)

At the start of any decompose / onboarding session, before any `vivia_create`:

1. **Check the local working file first.** `Read` `.vivia/<workflow>-<projectIdentifier>.md`. If it exists, that is your working state.
2. If the local file is missing: `vivia_activity project='<identifier>' since='<last certain instant>'` shows everything created or changed while you were away; `vivia_get project='<identifier>' view='meta'` re-reads the description. If a Decomposition Plan or Onboarding Proposal section exists in the description, that is your authoritative plan.
3. Compare: which planned tasks already exist (the activity feed's `task_created` events name them by ref; `vivia_search project='<identifier>' status=[...]` fills gaps), which are missing.
4. **If existing tasks > 0:** you are resuming. Surface this to the user: "I see N tasks already exist in this project. The approved plan calls for M tasks. I'll create the M-N missing ones." Re-running the batch is safe: `vivia_create` dedupes by exact title and returns matches as `deduped`.
5. **If existing tasks == 0:** fresh run. Proceed normally.
6. **If existing tasks do not match the approved plan** (different titles, manually-created tasks, etc): surface the conflict. Ask the user how to proceed. Do not silently overwrite.

---

## 5. Idempotent batch creation

**The server dedupes for you.** `vivia_create` skips items whose exact title already exists in the project and returns them as `deduped` (still usable as edge endpoints in the same call). A restarted decompose can therefore re-send the same batch payload verbatim:

- Same payload, second run → `created: []`, `deduped: [every task]`, existing edges silently skipped. Clean no-op.
- Partial first run → the re-run creates only the missing tail.
- `onDuplicate='error'` flips the behavior to reject-the-whole-batch when duplication would signal a planning bug rather than a resume.

Keep batches at ≤25 tasks with their internal edges (`key`-addressed) in the same call; chunk larger plans into consecutive batches. Read the `deduped` hint on every response so your working-file checklist stays truthful.

---

## 6. Quality checkpoints

Self-audit on a cadence. Defaults:

- **Decompose:** after every 10 task creates.
- **Onboarding:** after every 5 done-task creates (the higher-stakes write).
- **Manage:** after every 5 structural changes (status transitions, edge edits) in a single session.

The audit:

1. Re-read `references/artifacts.md` §1 (artifact quality).
2. Pick the last 3 tasks you created. For each, score:
   - Description: 2 to 4 sentences? If single-sentence, REWRITE.
   - ACs: 2 to 4 binary criteria? If single or vague, REWRITE.
   - Tags: all three dimensions (work-type, cross-cutting, tech) present? If any missing, FIX. Priority lives in the `priority` field, not in `tags`.
   - Category: matches a project category, not a forbidden one? If wrong, FIX.
3. If any of those need fixing, run `vivia_edit` (surgical ops: `str_replace` for description text, `add`/`update` by id for ACs, `set` for tags/category) BEFORE creating more.

Quality drift compounds. A bad task at position 15 is a 5-second fix. The same drift discovered at position 50 means rewriting 35 tasks.

---

## 7. Compaction signals (when to STOP and resume)

If you sense any of these, STOP creating tasks and run resume mode:

- You can not account for tasks you remember the plan calling for.
- You see existing tasks in the project but do not remember creating them.
- You are uncertain whether you have completed Phase 2 / 3 / 4.
- Decisions you remember making no longer appear in your context.
- The user said "continue where you left off" or "resume".
- The conversation has been long and your sense of progress is uncertain.

Do not power through. The user invoked you to produce quality work, not to restart their project from scratch on top of a partial graph.

---

## 8. What this means in practice

- Plan is durable: it lives in the project description (cross-machine) and the local working file (in-session).
- Progress is durable: progress checklist in the local working file; derivable from `vivia_activity since=...` and the batch creator's `deduped` responses if the local file is missing.
- Quality is enforced: periodic self-audit catches drift.
- Recovery is automatic: resume mode runs at every session start, reads local file first, falls back to project description.

The conversation can compact, the session can crash, the agent can lose track. Vivia state plus the local working file are the source of truth. Read from them, write to them, and trust them over your own memory.

---

## 9. Server vs agent-enforced rules

Some Vivia conventions are validated by the server; others depend on agent discipline. Knowing which is which prevents the agent from assuming a safety net that does not exist.

**Server-enforced** (the server rejects or warns):

- Cycle creation in the dependency graph (rejected with the chain named).
- Self-edges (rejected).
- Duplicate edges (rejected with "treat as success" guidance; in a `vivia_create` batch, existing edges are silently skipped instead).
- Batch title duplication (`vivia_create` dedupes by exact title; `onDuplicate='error'` rejects).
- Stale writes (`ifUpdatedAt` mismatch fails with the fresh `updatedAt`).
- `str_replace` precision (0 or ≥2 matches rejected with the occurrence count).
- Cancellation transparency: dependents stay blocked through cancelled deps' own unsatisfied prereqs.
- Identifier uniqueness per team (rejected on collision).
- Identifier rename cascades all task refs (with a warning hint).
- Delete preview-by-default with `_hints` instructing the second call.

**Agent-enforced** (no server safety net; quality decay risk):

- Tag taxonomy: kebab-case, all three dimensions (work-type, cross-cutting, tech) present, no codebase-area tags, no priority strings (priority lives in the `priority` field).
- Description length / quality: 2 to 4 sentences, no single-sentence descriptions.
- Acceptance criteria: 2 to 4 binary items, no "works correctly" filler.
- Edge note quality: substantive, no "needed" / "depends" placeholders.
- Lifecycle monotonicity: `draft → planned → in_progress → in_review → done`. The server hints on jumps but does not block them.
- `view='overview'` frequency: at most once per session. Skill discipline only.
- Destructive edit ops: `set` on a text field replaces it wholesale and `remove` deletes the item; the server does not warn and there is no undo (the activity log records that a change happened, not the prior content). Prefer `str_replace`/`append`/by-id ops; confirm wholesale rewrites with the user.

When in doubt, treat any rule that lives in `references/artifacts.md` or `references/lifecycle.md` as agent-enforced unless this section says otherwise.

## 10. Transport / auth errors are not retryable in-session

If a Vivia tool call returns one of these, **stop and surface to the user**:

- `requires re-authorization`, `token expired`, 401 / 403 from the MCP transport.
- 5xx from the server.
- Network errors (connection refused, timeout, DNS failure).

These mean the host's authentication or the connection itself is broken. The agent cannot self-heal: the user (or the host UI) has to re-authenticate or re-establish the connection. The correct response is:

1. Stop. Do not retry the same call. Do not silently proceed to the next step assuming the prior write succeeded.
2. Do not fabricate the downstream artifacts that would have followed a successful call. The Iron Law (`conventions.md` §1) applies: you cannot cite what you do not have.
3. Surface the failure to the user with the exact error text and the last completed step ("Vivia auth expired after creating LUM-12. Re-authenticate and I will resume from LUM-13.").
4. Wait for confirmation that the connection is restored before resuming.

A session that silently retries a 401 in a loop wastes tokens and produces nothing. A session that fabricates the rest of the workflow on the assumption the call succeeded produces actively misleading state.

---

## 11. Headless / non-interactive runs

The ask question tool tool requires a user attached to the session. Codex `exec`, Claude Agent SDK without a `canUseTool` callback, Gemini policy-deny contexts, and CI environments all reject or hang on the call. When you detect headless mode (tool errors with "no input available", "policy denied", or equivalent), do NOT loop or fabricate a default silently:

1. Pick the safest, most reversible default for the decision at hand.
2. Record both the question you would have asked and the default you chose in the task's `executionRecord` (or the local working file if you are pre-task).
3. Surface the assumption in the next interactive turn so the user can override.

Headless mode is not a license to skip pushback. If a decision genuinely cannot be defaulted (auth provider, deployment target, primary data store), stop and emit a structured error rather than guessing.
