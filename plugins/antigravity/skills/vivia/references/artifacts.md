# Vivia artifact rules

These rules set the quality bar for all Vivia artifacts: titles, descriptions,
acceptance criteria, executionRecords, decisions, files, tags, edges,
categories, and Markdown tone.

Agents read this file when about to create, refine, or audit an artifact. The Iron Law of grounding (`conventions.md` §1) applies at every step.

> Sections of this file are mirrored by the composer phase extracts in the claude-code plugin (`plugins/claude-code/skills/composer/references/`); when you edit a mirrored section, update those extracts and bump the pin in their `sources.json`.

## 1. Task artifact quality

### Title

Verb plus noun, imperative.

```
GOOD: "Implement JWT auth"
GOOD: "Fix Queue::front returning a copy"
GOOD: "Profile renderer hot path"
GOOD: "Train baseline ResNet on internal dataset"

BAD: "Auth"
BAD: "Queue stuff"
BAD: "Performance"
```

### `description`

A coding agent or engineer reads this first when picking up a task. It must give
enough information to start the work. Keep it concise and clear.

Cover, depending on task type:

- **Feature**: what the capability does, who it serves, where it lives in the architecture.
- **Bug**: what is broken, when it manifests, why it matters, and the suspected root cause if known.
- **Refactor / improvement**: what changes, what stays the same, why it is worth doing now.
- **Research / investigation**: what the question is, why it needs answering, what a good answer looks like.
- **Chore / setup / docs**: what needs doing and why now.

- **Solution sketch:** if you have one, include it. "Use Drizzle, mirror the patterns in `lib/data/task.ts`" is more useful than "Define the database tables".
- **No speculation:** do not pad with implementation guesses when the approach is uncertain. The implementation plan is for that.

Length: 2 to 4 sentences for most tasks. Up to 6 to 8 sentences for genuinely complex tasks. Single-sentence descriptions are never acceptable: the server flags them in `_hints`; rewrite before moving on.

**For onboarding** (writing descriptions for tasks that already shipped): write the description as if the task were being created BEFORE the work, knowing what you now know about the codebase. The reader must be able to re-derive the work from the description. Do not write "added the auth middleware". Write "Build the JWT auth middleware in `lib/auth/middleware.ts`. Validate Bearer tokens against the user table, set `req.user`, reject on expiry. Required by every protected route."

```
GOOD (feature, web SaaS):
"Build the habit completion endpoint at POST /api/habits/:id/complete. Inserts
into habit_logs with the user's timezone-adjusted date. Returns the updated
streak count. Idempotent on (habit_id, log_date): duplicate calls return the
existing log. Used by both the web dashboard and the iOS widget."

GOOD (bug, simulation engine):
"Fix Queue::front returning a copy instead of a reference. Spec §4.2.4.2
requires the head pointer to be modifiable in-place so Airport::moveToRunway
can swap it out without a re-insert. Currently caught by a unit test on
takeoff_flow. Likely a one-line change in include/Queue.h."

GOOD (research, ML platform):
"Investigate whether torch.compile improves training throughput on the
ResNet-50 baseline. Question: does compile-time speedup outweigh JIT overhead
on our 8-GPU pod? A good answer is a benchmark script plus a one-paragraph
recommendation comparing wall-clock per epoch and peak memory."

GOOD (refactor, embedded firmware):
"Move the SPI driver from polling to DMA. Same public surface (spi_send,
spi_recv), same wire protocol. Internally use STM32 HAL DMA1 channel 3 for
TX. Reduces CPU usage during sensor reads from ~15% to <1% per existing
profile traces."

GOOD (feature, game engine):
"Add deterministic frame stepping to the simulation tick. New API
Engine::stepFrame(uint32_t seed) so replay tooling and netcode tests can
re-run identical state from a recorded seed. Affects PhysicsWorld, Scheduler,
and the InputBuffer drain order."

GOOD (data / dbt model build):
"Build the daily_active_users dbt model in models/marts/engagement/. Reads
from stg_events.session_started, deduplicates on (user_id, date_trunc('day',
event_ts)), excludes internal traffic via is_internal flag from dim_users.
Materializes incremental on event_date with a 7-day lookback window. Used by
the Looker `Engagement Overview` dashboard and the weekly stakeholder report."

GOOD (BA / metric definition):
"Define the gross_margin metric in the dbt metrics layer. Formula: (revenue
- cogs) / revenue, dimensioned by product_line, channel, and order_month.
Source: fct_orders joined to dim_products. Replaces the four near-duplicate
SQL versions currently maintained by Sales Ops, Finance, and Marketing.
Stakeholders: CFO weekly review, RevOps dashboard."

BAD: "Improve the database."
BAD: "Make auth better."
BAD: "Fix the bug in queue."
BAD: "Build the dashboard."
```

### `acceptanceCriteria`

2 to 4 items. Each criterion must be **binary**: a reviewer can answer YES or NO without ambiguity.

```
GOOD:
- "Running bun run db:push creates all tables without errors"
- "User table has id, email, name, passwordHash, createdAt columns"
- "FK from tasks.projectId to projects.id with ON DELETE CASCADE"
- "Seed script creates 3 test users and 2 projects with tasks"

GOOD (firmware):
- "spi_send returns within 50µs at 80MHz clock measured on logic analyzer"
- "DMA TX completion fires interrupt; no busy-loop in the driver"
- "spi_recv returns 0xFF when MISO is held high, verified on the bench"

GOOD (data / dbt):
- "dbt run --select daily_active_users completes in under 90s on prod warehouse"
- "Row count of daily_active_users on 2026-05-01 matches stg_events session count to within 0.1%"
- "dbt test passes: not_null on user_id and event_date, unique on (user_id, event_date)"
- "Looker `Engagement Overview` dashboard refreshes against the new model with no broken tiles"

GOOD (BA / analysis deliverable):
- "Churn analysis SQL in analyses/2026q2_churn.sql returns the 14 churned cohorts with ARR per cohort"
- "Numbers reconcile with finance_actuals.gross_revenue to within $500 for every month in scope"
- "Stakeholder review notes from the 2026-05-08 RevOps sync are attached to the task"

BAD:
- "Database works"
- "All tables created"
- "Tests pass"
- "Performance is good"
- "Dashboard looks right"
- "Numbers match"
```

The server flags tasks with one AC in `_hints`; rewrite them. Rewrite vague ACs
such as "works correctly", "is complete", or "performs well" before planning.

### `executionRecord` (only on `in_review`, `done`, and `cancelled`)

- **Length:** 3 to 5 sentences.
- **Distinct from `description`:** description = scope + role; executionRecord = HOW it was built (or WHY it was abandoned).
- **Include:** function names, file paths, endpoints, data formats.
- **Exclude:** debugging stories, false starts, filler.
- **For `cancelled`:** rationale (why the work was abandoned), approaches tried, and decisions learned. Use the same shape as a done record for a non-shipping outcome.
- **Deliverables section (optional):** when the task ships non-code artifacts, a `## Deliverables` list (path or URL plus the exact regeneration command per artifact) extends the record beyond the sentence core.
- **Draft tasks must NOT carry an `executionRecord`.** That field implies the task shipped.

### `decisions`

One-liner per decision. Format: **CHOICE + WHY**.

Where decisions come from:

- **Refinement, planning, or implementation conversation.** When the user and
  the agent (or two agents) settle on a choice, record it as a decision. Record
  it without waiting for a reminder. If you are unsure whether a choice is a
  decision, ask the user for confirmation.
- **Onboarding (special case)**: the agent reads existing artifacts to recover decisions made before Vivia entered the picture. Sources: manifest files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Package.swift`), README and design docs, commit messages with words like *chose*, *switched*, *replaced*, *migrated*. If a decision is not grounded in any of those, omit it. Better a shorter list than fabrication.

```
GOOD (web): "Chose Redis for refresh tokens. Need fast revocation lookups."
GOOD (web): "Switched from Prisma to Drizzle. See package.json migration commit."
GOOD (sim): "Use std::vector for the Queue backing storage. Cheap front() lookup, fast tail insert; spec is silent on container choice."
GOOD (ML):  "Chose ONNX runtime over PyTorch for inference. 30% lower p99 on the target Jetson Orin."
GOOD (embedded): "Pick Zephyr over FreeRTOS for the new flight controller. Built-in CAN driver, Apache-2.0 license."
GOOD (agentic): "Use a per-thread tool registry. Two concurrent agent loops were stepping on each other's MCP client state."
GOOD (data): "Use dbt incremental over full-refresh on daily_active_users. Source events table is 4B rows; full-refresh exceeds the 30-minute warehouse SLA."
GOOD (BA): "Adopt dbt metrics layer over per-dashboard SQL. Four duplicates of gross_margin already exist across Looker, Tableau, and the weekly deck; one definition replaces them all."

BAD: "Used Drizzle"
BAD: "We picked Redis because it's good"
BAD: "Decided to do it that way"
BAD: "dbt is better"
```

Never invent. If a decision is not grounded in conversation, code, or the artifacts above, leave it out.

### `files`

- **Format:** plain repo-relative path strings. No backticks, no quoting.
- **Coverage:** every file created or modified for `done` tasks.
- **Empty `files=[]` is the correct value whenever paths cannot be cited:** pre-implementation tasks (`draft`, `planned`) where the code does not exist yet, research or decision-only tasks, Vivia-only refinements. **Leave empty rather than speculate.**

---

## 2. Tag dimensions and first-class fields

Every task, in every status, must carry tags across the three tag dimensions below. Reuse existing tags from `vivia_get project='<identifier>' view='meta'` before coining new ones.

| Dimension | Count | Vocabulary |
|---|---|---|
| **Work type** | exactly 1 | `bug`, `feature`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf` |
| **Cross-cutting concern** | ≥1 | quality attribute (`security`, `a11y`, `dx`, `perf`, `reliability`, `observability`, `i18n`, `compliance`, `safety`) or feature cluster spanning multiple categories (web: `onboarding-flow`, `live-replay`; aerospace: `flight-control`, `mission-planning`; agentic: `agent-loop`, `eval-harness`; ML: `inference-pipeline`, `data-drift`; financial: `risk-engine`, `pricing-model`) |
| **Tech** | at most 2 | most important stack pieces the task touches; pull from manifest deps |

### First-class fields (priority, estimate, assignees)

These are top-level columns on every task, set at creation (`vivia_create` item fields) or via `vivia_edit` (`set field='priority'` etc.). They are NOT tags.

- **`priority`** (one of `urgent`, `core`, `normal`, `backlog`). Required-on-create-by-convention: pick deliberately. Defaults: onboarding (shipped features) lands at `core`; decompose picks per task and avoids `core` everywhere or `urgent` everywhere (the dimension carries no signal then). A 30-task project usually has 3 to 6 `urgent` tasks and the rest split between `core`, `normal`, and `backlog`.
- **`estimate`** (Fibonacci story points: `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`). Optional. `1` is trivial, `2` and `3` are routine, `5` is nontrivial, `8` and `13` are risky or multi-day. If a task feels larger than `13`, split it (§5).
- **`assigneeIds`** (array of team-member user UUIDs). Optional. Declares ownership / intent, not concurrent execution; the single-worker `in_progress` invariant still holds. Each id must be a member of the project's owning team (the server rejects non-members at write time). Discover teammate UUIDs via `vivia_workspace action='members'`.

**Do NOT tag:**

- Priority: that is the `priority` field's job. Setting `urgent`, `core`, `normal`, or `backlog` as tags duplicates the field and adds no signal.
- Codebase area: use `category`. **Test: would this name plausibly be a category in some other project shape?** `render-loop`, `effect-system`, `auth`, `payments`, `inference`, `marts`, `flight-control`, `hal-drivers` all answer YES. They name subsystems or product areas, even when the project category list does not include them. Tags cover quality attributes (`security`, `a11y`, `perf`, `reliability`, `observability`, `dx`, `compliance`, `safety`, `i18n`) and feature clusters that span categories (`onboarding-flow`, `agent-loop`, `mission-planning`, `live-replay`). If a candidate tag names a subsystem, propose it as a category at the gate or use an existing category. Do not create an area-shaped tag because the category list lacks a good slot. Fix the category list instead.
- Task status: that is `status`'s job.
- Generic adjectives like "important", "main", "primary".

**Honoring user-specified tags:** if the user explicitly tagged something, preserve their tags. Add the missing dimensions if any of the three are absent.

**Tech tag examples by domain:**

- Web: `react`, `next`, `drizzle`, `postgres`, `tailwind`
- Mobile: `swift`, `swiftui`, `kotlin`, `coreml`, `room`
- Game: `unity`, `unreal`, `cpp`, `glsl`, `wgsl`
- Simulation: `cpp`, `fortran`, `mpi`, `cuda`
- Embedded: `c`, `rust`, `freertos`, `stm32-hal`, `zephyr`
- ML: `pytorch`, `jax`, `triton`, `clickhouse`, `dvc`
- Financial: `python`, `quantlib`, `numpy`, `arrow`
- Data / analytics / BA: `sql`, `dbt`, `bigquery`, `snowflake`, `postgres`, `looker`, `tableau`, `metabase`, `powerbi`, `airflow`, `dagster`

Pull tech tags from the project's actual stack. Do not invent.

---

## 3. Edge types and decision criteria

Two types: `depends_on` (source needs target done first) and `relates_to` (informational link).

**Use `depends_on` when** the source task **cannot start or complete** without the target's output:

- Source needs code, APIs, or schema produced by the target.
- Source needs decisions or configuration defined in the target.

**Use `relates_to` when** tasks share context but **neither blocks the other**:

- They touch the same area of code but can be built independently.
- One task's decisions are useful context for the other, but not required.

**Use this test:** if removing the target task makes the source impossible, use `depends_on`. If removal only makes the source harder or less informed, use `relates_to`.

**Edge notes propagate to coding agent context.** Empty notes ("needed", "depends") are forbidden. Write them as a brief to a developer about to start the source task: what specifically does this task get from the target?

```
GOOD (web): "User API endpoints need the JWT middleware and token
validation helpers built in the auth task. See lib/auth/middleware.ts."

GOOD (sim): "Crash flow runs each tick at the head of landingQueue.
Needs TimeController's per-tick hook structure built in NVK-18."

GOOD (agentic): "Tool registration depends on the agent loop's MCP client
init. Tools added after init are missed by in-flight agents."

GOOD (embedded): "BMP280 sustained-read fix depends on the i2c
clock-stretch patch in firmware-22. Without it the sensor returns 0xFF."

GOOD (ML): "Inference server depends on the model export task producing
ONNX with opset 18. Older opsets miss the GroupNorm op."

GOOD (data): "Looker `Engagement Overview` dashboard depends on the
daily_active_users dbt model. Tile queries select from the marts schema
and break if the model is renamed or its grain changes."

GOOD (BA): "The Q2 churn analysis depends on the gross_margin metric
definition in the dbt metrics layer. Without it, the cohort ARR column
defaults to the legacy SQL formula and reconciles 0.6% off finance_actuals."

BAD: "needs auth"
BAD: "depends on this"
BAD: "related"
```

## 4. Categories

Categories drive drawer grouping in the UI. Every task gets exactly one. They are set in exactly four moments:

1. When the project is created (the user names them, or you propose them at the gate).
2. During decompose, as part of the Phase 1 plan presented to the user before any write.
3. During onboarding, as part of the proposal presented at the Phase 3 gate.
4. When the user explicitly asks to add or remove one.

Do not silently coin a new category mid-decompose, mid-onboarding, or while creating an ad-hoc task. The category list is part of a project's scaffolding; unnecessary categories add clutter to every overview view.

### How to determine categories for a project

You are choosing the architectural layers / product areas / subsystems of a single project. Walk through:

1. **What does the project do at a high level?** Web app, mobile app, game, simulation, firmware, ML pipeline, agentic system, CLI, library, hardware controller, financial model, something else.
2. **What are the distinct subsystems a developer would think about separately while building?** Database vs API vs UI; or kernel vs renderer vs assets; or HAL vs drivers vs protocols; or agent loop vs tools vs memory.
3. **Are there cross-cutting product concerns that warrant their own layer?** Auth, integration, testing, docs, safety.
4. **Pick 4 to 8 names. Stop.** More is sprawl. Fewer is no signal.

### Hard rules

- 4 to 8 categories per project.
- The list is server-enforced: `vivia_create`, `vivia_edit`, and project-scoped `vivia_search` reject a category outside the project's vocabulary and name the valid set inline. Read it via `vivia_get project view='meta'`; extend it deliberately via `vivia_workspace action='update' categories=[...]`, never by coining mid-task. Rename or remove an in-use entry only via `action='rename_category'` / `action='delete_category'` (they move or uncategorize the tasks atomically); rewriting the array does not touch task rows and orphans them.
- Architectural layer / product area / subsystem only. Not process phases (`requirements`, `planning`, `review`). Not work types (`bugs`, `features` are tags, not categories). Not priorities.
- **Test: would this be a tag in some other project shape?** If yes, it's cross-cutting, not a category. Quality attributes (`security`, `perf`, `a11y`, `reliability`, `observability`, `dx`, `compliance`, `safety`) and multi-category feature clusters (`onboarding-flow`, `agent-loop`, `flight-control`, `inference-pipeline`, `dashboard-refresh`) belong in the tag dimension. Categories are subsystems the project shapes itself around: directories, build targets, layers a developer thinks about separately. §2 and §4 are mirrors. A name passes one test, not both.
- Nouns. `data` not `data-modeling`. `ui` not `ui-work`.
- Pick once at creation. Mid-project additions miscategorize earlier tasks. Resist.
- Decompose and onboarding agents must surface their proposed categories at the gate. No silent application.

### Forbidden categories

- `requirements`, `architecture`, `planning`, `review`, `refinement`: process phases, not subsystems.
- `bugs`, `features`, `improvements`: work types. Use the `tags` work-type dimension.
- `important`, `critical`, `priority`: use the `priority` field.
- `frontend-work`, `backend-stuff`: drop the suffix.
- `open-questions`, `tbd`, `misc`: resolve them with proper tasks, do not give them a drawer.

### Common starting points

These are familiar starting sets, not a canonical menu. Borrow when nothing in the project description demands a different shape. Replace with project-specific names (`flight-control`, `pricing`, `agent-loop`) when the project has different layers.

| Category | Use for |
|---|---|
| `setup` | Scaffolding, project init, CI/CD, build system |
| `infra` | Deployment, hosting, monitoring, observability infra |
| `data` | Schema, migrations, persistence, seed |
| `auth` | Authentication, authorization, RBAC, secrets |
| `api` | Backend endpoints, request validation, server-side logic |
| `ui` | Frontend components, pages, UX |
| `core` | Domain logic, business rules, kernel, engine internals |
| `sdk` | Library code, client SDKs, public surface |
| `cli` | Command-line interface, internal tooling |
| `integration` | Third-party services, webhooks, plugins, external APIs |
| `testing` | Test infrastructure, fixtures, evals, QA |
| `docs` | Documentation, examples, guides, release notes |

### Project-type guidance

Defaults that match the actual architecture of common project shapes. Adapt to what the specific project is doing.

- **Web / SaaS**: `setup`, `data`, `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `integration`, `testing`, `docs`.
- **Mobile (iOS / Android)**: `setup`, `data`, `auth`, `screens`, `services`, `native`, `testing`.
- **Game / engine**: `core`, `rendering`, `physics`, `audio`, `assets`, `ai`, `netcode`.
- **Simulation / scientific**: `core`, `models`, `io`, `scenarios`, `verification`, `docs`.
- **Embedded / firmware**: `hal`, `drivers`, `protocols`, `bootloader`, `testing`, `docs`.
- **ML / data platform** (production ML systems with training and serving): `data-pipeline`, `training`, `inference`, `evaluation`, `serving`.
- **Data warehouse / analytics engineering** (dbt project, SQL marts, transformations): `sources`, `staging`, `marts`, `metrics`, `tests`, `docs`. Add `pipelines` if Airflow/Dagster orchestration is its own surface; `seeds` if reference data has a meaningful footprint.
- **Business analyst / BI** (dashboards, reports, ad-hoc analysis, stakeholder deliverables): `requirements-intake`, `analysis`, `dashboards`, `metrics`, `data-quality`, `documentation`. Add `stakeholders` if recurring stakeholder reviews are first-class; `playbooks` if reusable analysis templates are part of the deliverable. Note: `requirements-intake` here is a product surface (BRDs, stakeholder asks tracked as artifacts), not the forbidden process-phase `requirements`.
- **Mixed dbt-shop + BI delivery** (a dbt rebuild that ships into stakeholder-owned BI dashboards, common when Finance / Sales / Marketing trust degrades and the fix is one source of truth fed into existing tools): merge the two vocabularies. Common landing: `sources`, `staging`, `marts`, `metrics`, `dashboards`, `data-quality`, `governance`. Pick `tests` over `data-quality` if testing has its own surface; `documentation` over `governance` if change-management is light.
- **Agentic system / app** (an LLM loop with tools and memory): `core` (agent loop, planner, orchestration), `tools` (function calling, MCP, capability adapters), `memory` (context, state, long-term storage), `models` (LLM client, routing, caching), `evals` (scenarios, regression harness), `safety` (guardrails, output validation). Add `ui` if there is a chat or dashboard surface; `prompts` if prompt engineering is its own discipline.
- **Multi-agent system** (orchestrator + worker agents, tools shared): `orchestration` (planner, scheduler, routing), `agents` (worker agent definitions), `tools`, `memory`, `models`, `evals`, `safety`.
- **Financial / quant**: `models`, `pricing`, `risk`, `reporting`, `data`, `ui`.
- **Library / SDK / CLI**: `core`, `api`, `cli`, `examples`, `testing`, `docs`.
- **Hardware / aerospace / defense**: borrow from embedded plus domain layers like `flight-control`, `telemetry`, `safety`, `mission-planning`, `comms`.
- **Hackathon / throwaway**: 4 categories or fewer. Do not over-decompose.

---

## 5. Granularity

**1 to 4 hours per task.** A coding agent should complete one in a single session.

> **Starting count is not a cap.** The numbers below seed decompose and
> onboarding. They do not list every task a project will ever need. Projects
> gain tasks as work appears. If a parent agent or test rig sets a lower cap,
> follow it and record the deviation in your transcript or local working file.

| Project size | Starting task count |
|---|---|
| Hackathon / 1-day spike | 5 to 10 |
| Simple (≤5 features, single user role) | 10 to 20 |
| Medium (5 to 15 features, several roles) | 20 to 40 |
| Complex (15+ features, multiple subsystems) | 40 to 80 |
| Enterprise / multi-team / long-running | 60 to 120 foundation tasks. The graph grows organically into the hundreds or thousands as teams add work. |

Too small (under 30 minutes): overhead exceeds work.
Too large (over 1 day): hidden subtasks, unclear scope, hard to track.

When in doubt, split. Tasks become more useful, and more parallelizable, as they shrink toward the 1-hour mark.

---

## 6. Markdown formatting and tone

Applies to `description`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `executionRecord`, `implementationPlan`, `decisions`, and edge `note`. Not to `files` (plain paths) or `tags` (kebab-case).

### Structure

- Bullet lists (`-`) for 3 or more items. Never run-on prose.
- Backticks for code references: file paths, function names, endpoints, variables, package names.
- Paragraph breaks between distinct topics.
- Headings (`##`, `###`) only in long fields like `implementationPlan` and the executionRecord's optional `Deliverables` section.

### Tone: never sound like AI

The text you write into Vivia is read by other engineers. It must read like an engineer wrote it, not a chatbot.

**Do not use:**

- Em dash punctuation. Use periods, commas, parentheses, or colons.
- Hedging openers: "I think", "perhaps", "seems to", "might be", "arguably".
- Enthusiasm: "Great question", "Awesome", "Exciting", "Love this".
- Throat-clearing: `Let me dive into`, `I hope this helps`, `Here's the thing`, `To be honest`.
- Marketing words: `comprehensive`, `robust`, `powerful`, `leverage`, `utilize`, `ensure`, `facilitate`, `seamless`, `game-changer`, `best-in-class`.
- Adverb-heavy openers: "Importantly", "Crucially", "Notably", "Essentially", "Basically".
- Empty filler: `It's worth noting that`, `It should be mentioned`, `As a matter of fact`.
- Performative summaries at the end: "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you need anything else!"

**Do:**

- Subject, verb, object.
- Active voice.
- Concrete over abstract. "Adds 50ms p99" beats "improves performance".
- Specific over vague. "Stripe webhook handler" beats "payment integration".
- Cut adverbs.
- One idea per sentence.

### Length

Prefer concise text. Remove filler, AI throat-clearing, and repetition. Do not
remove information that a reader needs. Use 6 to 8 sentences when the task has
multiple components, a complex cause, or a multi-part research question. The
rule is no fluff, not no length. A clear six-sentence description is better than
a short description that omits key information.
